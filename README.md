# CryptoClustering

In this assignment, I used Python and unsupervised machine learning to predict if cryptocurrenciees are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

NOTE: Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC and is intended for educational purposes only.

First, I imported all my dependencies and libraries including pandas, hvplot, and scikit-learn as well as the generated data in the CSV file and processed the data into a DataFrame. Then using StandardScaler, I scaled the data. Using the elbow method, I found the best k-value was 4 and graphed the clusters.

Using the PCA method, I reduced the features to three components and graphed the data using the elbow method which resulted in a k-value of 4. I then graphed the clusters and compared the elbow graphs and scatter graphs.
